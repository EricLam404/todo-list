# To-Do List
Created a task organizer modeled after a To-Do list.


# Description

## Main Panel
The main panel is where each tasks will show up. You can sort tasks based on due date by toggling the "Due Date" icon. You can sort tasks either by **ascending order** or **descending order**. 
#### Local Storage
The tasks are saved to your local storage, so if you leave or refresh the tab, the tasks will still save
### Task options
**Checkbox:** You can click the checkbox when you are finished with your task
**Name:** You can change the name of the task by clicking the current task name then change the name
**Project:** You can change the project catagory of the task by clicking the current project name then change the project name
**Priority:** You can change the priority of the task by clicking on the priority button, which will give a dropdown menu for the priorities 
**Date:** You can change the date by clicking on the date and select a new date
**Delete:** By clicking on the delete button, you can remove the task

## Sidebar
The sidebar allows quick access to various task categories:

**Home:** shows all tasks
**Projects:** filters for by project name for each task

The project helped reinforce several JS topics: modular patterns, factory functions, single responsibility principle, local storage.
